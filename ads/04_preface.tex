\begin{abstract}
This thesis presumes background knowledge in the realm of blockchain technology. At the very least, the concepts presented by Bitcoin should be familiar to the reader in order to ensure full comprehensibility of the technical proceedings presented and comparisons drawn herein. Published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \cite{nist2018} may be consulted as a general introduction to this landscape. The authorâ€™s knowledgeability has been demonstrated through the research conducted in \cite{sauer2016}.
