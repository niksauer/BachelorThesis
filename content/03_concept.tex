\section{Incentivized Deposit-Refund System}
\label{sec:incentivizedSystem}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:incentivizedOverview}
An incentivized deposit-refund system, as is outlined in the following, aims to:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
  \item \label{bolsterQuote} bolster the quote of beverages sold in reusable packaging
  \item \label{preventPollution} prevent pollution of the environment caused from throwing away bottles
  \item support the cause of environmental agencies
\end{enumerate}

From a game theoretical perspective, \ref{bolsterQuote} and \ref{preventPollution} are presumably achieved by \footnote{Lending itself to the fact that solely threatening retailers and bottlers with the introduction of a deposit-refund system had not been a successful approach (comp.~\autoref{ftn:presumedEffects} and \autoref{fig:reusableQuoteDevelopment} on pp.~\rangeref{presumedHappenedEffects}).}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item rewarding consumers who purchase reusable bottles
  \item punishing consumers whose bottles are eventually thrown away
\end{itemize}

To translate these measures into reality, it will be necessary to alter the current deposit-refund system (see~\ref{sec:depositRefundCycle}) so that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item non-claimed deposits are redistributed among agencies and reusable bottle consumers
  \item a penalty is added onto future deposits of consumers who repeatedly pollute
\end{itemize}

Practically, this will require garbage collection to report how many and which specific one-way bottles have been thrown away. Otherwise, it will not be possible to calculate the amount of non-claimed deposits and identify which consumer was responsible for the bottle at last. The latter infers that bottles must be uniquely identifiable. On the other hand, such a system can only be realized if retailers forward the information that a consumer has bought reusable bottles and has thereby become eligible to receive rewards. Furthermore, to establish proper ownership, they must also report which one-way bottles a consumer has purchased. Lastly, it should be prevented that anybody can report these figures, pretend to be an environmental agency or claim someone else's rewards. This core functionality, together with the existing minimum level of service, can be expressed in terms of the different interactions a certain user may have with the system, known as a use case diagram and given by \autoref{fig:useCaseOverview}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/concept/use_case_overview}
  \caption{Use case overview}
  \label{fig:useCaseOverview}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

From this overview, it becomes apparent that a revised approach will essentially incorporate an accounting layer to enable the punishment and rewarding of consumers. Basic protocols of interaction (i.e.~buying and returning a bottle) should only be modified to the minimum extent needed.

\subsection{Proposed Rules}
\label{sec:rules}
Having given a high-level introduction to an incentivized deposit-refund system, this section aims to provide an exemplary set of rules that may constitute the underlying business logic. Again, it must be noted that this only serves as a guideline for architecting such a solution. The precise economics, psychological effectiveness and ethics introduced hereby are disregarded (comp.~\ref{sec:goalsScope}).

\subsubsection{Rewards \& Donations}

\begin{itemize}
 	\item 50\% of non-claimed deposits are reserved for donations (\textit{agency fund})
  	\item 50\% of non-claimed deposits are reserved for rewards (\textit{consumer fund})
  	\item rewards and donations can be claimed once in each period
  	\item a period's duration is set at 4 weeks
  	\item a consumer's reward ($r_c$) is based on the relative amount of reusable bottles ($b$) he has purchased within the previous period, thus can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
r_c = \frac{b}{b_{total}} \times f_c
\label{eq:rewardCalculation}
\end{equation}

where $b_{total}$ denotes the total number of reusable bottles sold within that period and $f_c$ resembles the consumer fund

	\item non-claimed rewards are withheld % for self-financing
  	\item the agency fund ($f_a$) is evenly distributed, so that each's donation ($d$) will be $d = f_a/n$, where $n$ refers to the number of approved agencies
  	\item non-claimed donations remain available for all agencies in the next period
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Penalties}

\begin{itemize}
 	\item if a consumer repeatedly pollutes, he must pay a penalty on top of each deposit
	\item the threshold ($t$) to receive a penalty is set at 5 thrown away bottles
  	\item the penalty's value ($v$) is set at \EUR{0.05}
  	\item a consumer's penalty ($p_c$) is proportional to the number of bottles ($b$) he has thrown away during the lifetime of this system, meaning that: 

\begin{equation}
p_c = \frac{b - (b \mod t)}{t} \times v
\label{eq:penaltyCalculcation}
\end{equation}

  	\item the penalty is refunded, if the consumer returns the bottle on his own
  	\item the penalty is seized, if the bottle is thrown away or returned by someone else
%  	\item seized penalties are also used for self-financing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:FRs}
In accordance to \autoref{sec:incentivizedOverview} and \autoref{sec:rules}, the following functional requirements are defined as the bare minimum of features any implementation must provide in order to be used as the accounting backend of an incentivized deposit-refund system. These requirements are expressed from the perspective of an end-user who hopes to achieve different goals by using the system and are grouped by the various roles encountered (comp.~\autoref{fig:useCaseOverview}).

Of course, consumers and environmental agencies will also expect a method to claim the promised rewards and donations respectively, so that two additional requirements are formulated subsequently.

\paragraph{Garbage collector}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\sffamily,label={\textbf{FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.4cm, ref=FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]
	\item As a garbage collector, I can report the number of thrown away one-way bottles, so that the amount of non-claimed deposits can be calculated. \label{itm:reportNumber}
	\item As a garbage collector, I can report the identifier of a thrown away one-way bottle, so that the responsible consumer can be punished. \label{itm:reportIdentifier}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Retailer}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.4cm, ref=FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]
	\item As a retailer, I can report that a consumer has purchased reusable bottles, so that he becomes eligible to receive rewards. \label{itm:reportReusablePurchase}
	\item As a retailer, I can report how many reusable bottles a consumer has bought, so that his share of rewards can be calculated. \label{itm:reportReusableNumber}
	\item As a retailer, I can report which one-way bottles a consumer has bought, so that the ownership of each bottle is recorded. \label{itm:reportOneWays}
	\item As a retailer, I can look up the penalty that a specific consumer must pay, so that this amount can be added onto the deposit of each bottle during purchase. \label{itm:lookUpPenalty}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Take-back point}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.4cm, ref=FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]
%	\item As a tack-back point, I can put in a claim to be reimbursed for making advance refunds, so that I do not experience a loss by offering this service.
	\item As a tack-back point, I can report which one-way bottles a consumer has returned, so that the penalty, if raised, can be refunded or seized accordingly. \label{itm:reportOneWayReturn}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consumer}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.4cm, ref=FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item As a consumer, I can claim a reward for having purchased reusable bottles, so that I will be motivated to so in the future even though one-way packaging is lighter (and more durable) when compared to most reusable bottles. \label{itm:claimReward}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Environmental agency}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.4cm, ref=FR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item As an environmental agency, I can claim a donation, so that my cause will be better supported through the funding secured. \label{itm:claimDonation}
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{Preconditions}
\label{sec:preconditions}
While an incentivized deposit-refund system may be effective, it does assume a variety of conditions that must be in place for it to function properly. As previously hinted, they can be described as the:

\begin{description}
	\item[Obligation to report thrown away one-way bottles]
	\hfill \\
	In addition to reporting the total number of thrown away bottles\hide{(\ref{itm:reportNumber})}, garbage collection must also be obliged to communicate the individual identifiers\hide{(\ref{itm:reportIdentifier})}. This assumes that one-way bottles are marked with a label that is unique across all bottles in circulation. Finally, and to automate the whole process, special object recognition machinery will be required along the sorting belt of any given refuse disposal site.
	\item[Obligation to report bottle purchase]
	\hfill \\
	Retailers and initial distributors alike must report which particular one-way bottles a consumer has purchased\hide{(\ref{itm:reportOneWays})}. The same (i.e. quantity) goes for buying reusable bottles \hide{(\ref{itm:reportReusableNumber})} although this only happens through opt-in as people should not be forced to accept rewards. In both cases, it will be necessary to have consumers present a unique means of identification as they complete the purchase.
	\item[Obligation to levy penalty]
	\hfill \\
	Assuming that the consumer qualifies for a penalty, retailers must be impelled to impose this amount upon purchase which itself requires an extension to cash registers so that the amount can be queried dynamically\hide{(\ref{itm:lookUpPenalty})}, given that the consumer has been identified priorly.
	\item[Obligation to report one-way bottle return]
	\hfill \\
	Similar to reporting a purchase, tack-back points have to report which consumer had been responsible for returning a particular one-way bottle\hide{(\ref{itm:reportOneWayReturn})}. Since the return process can either be automated or executed manually (comp.~\autoref{fig:clearingProcess}), different mechanisms to identify the consumer will be needed.  
\end{description}

These prevailing conditions could be enforced by amending the system's legal basis (see~\ref{sec:legalBasis}) and then integrating the relevant clauses into the contracts that \ac{DPG} maintains with each participant (see~\ref{sec:DPGAdministration}). However, the exact realization including that of the measures needed as explained above is out of scope (comp.~\ref{sec:goalsScope}) and thus, assumed to be satisfied for the remainder of this paper. 

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:NFRs}
Whereas functional quality stresses conformance with the design specifications, structural quality addresses non-functional requirements like security and maintainability \cite[p.~2]{Martinez-Ortiz:2016:QMW:3011141.3011203}. Together, both can be used to constitute the evaluation framework for measuring a system's quality, better known as \ac{QoS}. \citeauthor{Liu:2004:QCP:1013367.1013379} argue that it is not practical to come up with a standard model of attributes because \ac{QoS} is a broad, context-dependent concept \cite[p.~67]{Liu:2004:QCP:1013367.1013379}. Therefore, the following list of desired structural properties is based on those already encompassed in the current deposit-refund system or those which are absolutely necessary to implement an incentivized version. All other traits will be left open for discussion in the end.

\paragraph{Access Security}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.7cm, ref=NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item The system shall distinguish between authorized and non-authorized users. More specifically, the individual features outlined above shall only be accessible to their designated user.\label{itm:accessSecurity}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Availability}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.7cm, ref=NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item The system shall be available for use between the hours of 6:00 am and 24:00 pm which is justified by the fact that most sales and returns will happen within this timeframe. Clients must therefore maintain a backlog of unsent reports and transmit these exceptions at the next possible point in time.\label{itm:operatingTimes}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Cost}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.7cm, ref=NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item The system shall be no more costly in operation than it currently is. Total membership and bottle registration fees may be taken as a baseline (see~\ref{sec:DPGRoles}).\label{itm:operatingCost}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Scalability}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.7cm, ref=NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item The system shall be able to handle all user requests and by such, shall be scalable to support unlimited growth in the number of actors, reports and claims.\label{itm:unlimitedGrowth}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Efficiency}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.7cm, ref=NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item The system shall execute any request by the end of the day to ensure the timely application of penalties, as well as to have a proper statement ready by the end of the month.\label{itm:responseTime}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Integrity}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, font=\sffamily, label={\textbf{NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}}},leftmargin=1.7cm, ref=NFR-\protect\twodigits{\theenumi}]  
	\item All monetary amounts (i.e.~rewards and donations) must be calculated accurately before being rounded down to two decimal places. The latter ensures that no more funds are distributed than are available. Additionally, only integer figures may be reported and must be recorded as is.\label{itm:calculcations}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Smart-Contract as a Clearing House}
\label{sec:centralClearingHouse}
The biggest roadblock to implementing an incentivized deposit-refund system (see~\ref{sec:incentivizedSystem}) is given by the fact that \ac{DPG} has decided against using a central clearing mechanism to settle refund claims of tack-back points (comp.~\nameref{sec:DPGAdministration} on \autopageref{sec:DPGAdministration}). Instead, refund claimants must invoice each of the initial distributors for which a bottle was taken back and present data proving the number of accepted bottles (comp.~\nameref{sec:depositRefundCycle} on \autopageref{sec:depositRefundCycle}). This design choice is easily explained because the law mandates that: \enquote{a deposit is to be charged by the distributor and each subsequent retailer} (comp.~\nameref{sec:legalBasis} in \ref{sec:legalBasis}). Obviously, transferring the deposit to an escrow account afterwards would not lead to any noticeable benefits compared to direct a settlement. Still, such a change in course will represent the major enabler to an incentivized deposit-refund system as is depicted in \autoref{fig:depositCycleFuture}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
	  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/concept/deposit_cycle_future_one_way_token}
	  \caption[Future deposit-refund cycle]{Future deposit-refund cycle \footnotemark}
	  \label{fig:depositCycleFuture}
\end{figure}

\footnotetext{An extended version detailing the three differently balanced accounting states (comp.~\ref{sec:depositRefundCycle}) can be found in the \autoref{app:concept} on \autopageref{fig:depositCycleFutureExtended}.}

\FloatBarrier

Leveraging Ethereum's decentralized application platform and built-in cryptocurrency (see~\ref{sec:ethereumOverview}), \ac{DPG} could provide participants of the deposit-refund cycle with a fully autonomous method for settling refund claims by deploying a smart-contract that will act as a central clearing house and simultaneously allow for the incentivized structure put forward. A semantic change to the regulatory underpinnings will not be required. 

For all this to work, the very first deposit charged for a one-way bottle must be converted to Ether and sent to the smart-contract (step 1a of \autoref{fig:depositCycleFuture})\label{itm:basicRequirement}. At the same time, a non-fungible token (see~\ref{sec:fungibility}) representing the newly introduced bottle must be created using the bottle's unique identifier and associated (step 1b of \autoref{fig:depositCycleFuture}) with the address of the purchaser's \ac{EOA} (see~\ref{sec:accounts}). This means that the only permitted means of identification will be an Ethereum address. Keeping in mind the actor's various obligations (see~\ref{sec:preconditions}), the remainder of the system will be implemented as following: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item [(2)] Like today, the deposit of a one-way bottle is still directly paid to the retailer upon each subsequent sale but as already indicated, not again transmitted to the smart-contract. However, should the consumer qualify for a penalty (see~\ref{sec:rules}), this penalty (converted to Ether) is sent to the smart-contract along with the purchase report itself. Furthermore, each report causes the token to be re-associated with the new consumer. In case that the previous owner had to pay a penalty \footnote{Even though unlikely, this indicates that a retailer has lost or thrown away one-way bottles.}, that amount will be credited to him for later withdrawal as he is not responsible for the bottle anymore.
	\item [(3a)] By returning a one-way bottle, the accompanying report triggers the smart-contract to compare the consumer's identity with that recorded for the bottle (i.e.~that associated with the token). Should these match, the penalty will be credited for later withdrawal. Otherwise, the penalty is withheld (comp.~\ref{sec:rules}). Irrespective of the outcome, the token is destroyed meaning that the bottle's identifier could theoretically be reused in the future. Additionally, tack-back points must physically refund the consumer (comp.~\ref{itm:levyDepositObligation} on \autopageref{itm:levyDepositObligation})
	\item [(3b)] Should the consumer decide to throw away a one-way bottle, this information is (likely) to be reported by garbage collection sooner or later and triggers an increase in the responsible consumer's record of thrown away bottles which is used to calculate his penalty (comp.~\autoref{eq:penaltyCalculcation}). Assuming that a penalty had been paid for this bottle, it is withheld (comp. \ref{sec:rules}). Lastly, the token is burned and the number of bottles which have been thrown away in the current period is incremented, as is required to correctly calculate \autoref{eq:rewardCalculation}.
	\item [(4)] Since tack-back points still directly refund consumers, settlement for these advance payments is needed. This happens by transmitting the same signed dataset which is used today and produced either by a reverse vending machine or a commissioned counting center (see~\ref{sec:depositRefundCycle}). The smart-contract can then verify the payload's signature, after which a message with equivalent value in Ether will be sent to the refund claimant's (i.e. the caller's) address. 
	\item [(5)] Environmental agencies can simply claim their donation by signing a transaction and addressing it to this smart-contract, though, for it to work, the encapsulated message must contain the appropriate function signature (see~\ref{sec:accounts}). Determining that a caller is indeed an environmental agency happens by looking up his approval status. Likewise, eligible consumers (i.e.~those that have been reported to have purchased reusable bottles) can claim their reward in the same fashion with the difference being that permission does not have to be checked since the reward amount is not statically calculated (comp.~\autoref{eq:rewardCalculation}) and by such would simply result in a zero value.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component Design}
Striving for a component-based design represents one of the most important best practices in software engineering because it facilitates developers in maintaining a complex system by decomposing it into parts that are easier to conceive, understand and program. At the same time, the process of dismantling a system should not happen arbitrarily but rather attempt to take the application's domain structure into account to reduce the likelihood of having to remedy large parts afterwards. Accordingly, \autoref{fig:classDiagramConcept} showcases the individual components that have been identified as being essential to realizing the high-level architecture presented beforehand.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
	  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/concept/class_diagram_concept_short}
	  \caption{Class design model}
	  \label{fig:classDiagramConcept}
\end{figure}

The classes (i.e.~contracts \cite[p.~75]{solidityDocs}) encountered within this (loosely typed) conceptual model can be categorized by the role they take in abstracting the system:

\begin{description}[format={\storedescriptionlabel}]
	\item[Accounting\label{itm:accounting}]
	\hfill \\
	As mentioned in \autoref{sec:incentivizedOverview}, some kind of an accounting layer will be needed to reward reusable bottle consumers. Here, a smart-contract called \texttt{DPGCore} will take upon this task and provide actors with \ref{itm:reportNumber}, \ref{itm:reportReusablePurchase} and \ref{itm:reportReusableNumber}. Since all reported figures are tied to a specific timeframe (i.e.~the current period) and rewards can only be claimed for the past period (comp.~\ref{sec:rules}), \texttt{DPGCore} maintains a reference to two distinct \texttt{Periods} which each track the total number of bottles that have been thrown away in that specific period, as well as the number of reusable bottles a particular \texttt{Consumer} has purchased. The connection to both properties allows \ref{itm:claimReward} and \ref{itm:claimDonation} to be implemented within the same contract. Finally, it makes available two additional functions that for one, enable the settlement process outlined above and two, offer the ability to lock down a deposit that has been transmitted by an initial distributor (comp.~\ref{itm:basicRequirement}). 
	
	By taking a closer look at the conceptual model presented, one can make out the fact that it will not be possible to directly put in a claim to be reimbursed, report a thrown away bottle or lock up a deposit because the methods are marked as protected. Consequently, they can only be exposed through inheritance. This behavior is intended considering that the penalty can be regarded as an extension to an incentivized deposit-refund system \footnote{As the name implies, incentivization primarily refers to rewarding reusable bottle purchases.} and by such, requires the APIs to be extended with additional arguments that capture the individual bottle identifiers. Further, this design choice will break up the monolith and simplify deployment should it be decided that a penalty is not needed for production, in which case the subclass \texttt{DPGBasic} can be used out of the box.
	\item[Access Control]
	\hfill \\
	To relieve \texttt{DPGCore} of the duty to additionally have to track which addresses resemble approved environmental agencies or garbage collectors, \texttt{DPGActorManager} has been established as a separate contract. It is advised that the same or some other key pair in possession of \ac{DPG} is used to deploy this smart-contract, as only the owner (i.e.~the deployer) will be able to add or remove additional \texttt{Actors}. Communication between \texttt{DPGCore} and \texttt{DPGActorManager} will happen by exchanging messages (see~\ref{sec:accounts}). Together, this will ensure \ref{itm:accessSecurity} in regard to false donation claims or thrown away bottle reports. Despite these measures, another, more concerning authorization scheme is still undefined. Prevention of false (reusable \footnote{Non-existent authorization would allow attackers to bluntly increase their share in rewards.}) bottle purchases could be done in two ways:
	
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item verify signature of signed purchase receipt (similar to refund claim)
  		\item maintain list of approved initial distributors and retailers
	\end{itemize}

	Both options would either require a change to existing cashier systems or mandate retailers on all trade levels to register with \ac{DPG} in order to verify their identify, as currently, this is only guaranteed for initial distributors (comp.~\ref{sec:DPGRoles}). On the other hand, option number two will prove handy in the bottle's return process which is another step that must be secured to prevent false accusations (i.e.~claiming that someone else has thrown away a one-way bottle \footnote{Again, such a weak spot could lead to a double attack in which an attacker would first increase his number of reusable bottle purchases and then report a large number of thrown away one-way bottles to further increase his already undeserved reward.}).
%	However, implementing these considerations are out of scope
	\item[Penalty]
	\hfill \\
	Partially discussed above and in \autoref{sec:centralClearingHouse}, a penalty arises from repeatedly detecting that a consumer has thrown away a one-way bottle. Detection occurs after garbage collection reports the identifier for that particular bottle, for which then the corresponding token is retrieved along with its owner. This \texttt{DPGToken} will be based on OpenZeppelin's reference implementation of the \texttt{ERC721} non-fungible token standard and even though reuse leads to additional project dependencies, it is still very much desirable because the underlying codebase is regularly tested and community-audited \footnote{\$4.5 Billion worth of digital assets are powered by OpenZeppelin smart-contracts \cite{openZeppelin}.} \cite{openZeppelinGitHub}. 
	
	By default, the \texttt{ERC721Token} contract does not allow users to mint new or burn existing tokens \cite{}. Therefore, subclassing must be used to expose these protected methods. At the same time, a barrier will be needed to prevent arbitrary usage. Generally, it can be argued that tokens shall only be managed by the application as a result of having received a report. To guarantee this behavior, all function calls within \texttt{DPGToken} will be restricted to \texttt{DPGPenalty}, hereby creating a fully autonomous debt-tracking entity, meaning that no human will be able to transfer their tokens in an attempt to get rid of the return responsibility.
	
	One consequence of separating the penalty's logic from \texttt{DPGCore} (comp.~\ref{itm:accounting} on \autopageref{itm:accounting}) is the need for an additional data structure that tracks how many one-way bottles a particular consumer has thrown away. This structure is given by \texttt{ConsumerStatistic}. Only now, \texttt{DPGPenalty} will be able to implement \ref{itm:reportIdentifier}, \ref{itm:reportOneWays}, \ref{itm:lookUpPenalty} and \ref{itm:reportOneWayReturn}, during which some of the functionality inherited from \texttt{DPGCore} will be re-encapsulated to add the bottle identifier as a function argument. In line with \ref{itm:operatingCost}, it will be possible to specify multiple bottles at once. Transaction cost (see~\ref{sec:gas}) reductions like these should be utilized whenever possible.
\end{description}

%In summary, the components outlined above will lead to five custom build artifacts of which three at most will be deployed \footnote{When a contract inherits from another, only a single contract is created on the blockchain as the code of all base contracts is copied into it \cite[p.~88]{solidityDocs}. Moreover, data structures like the \texttt{Actor} or \texttt{Period} do not constitute their own contract but will be rather realized as simple C-like structs.}. Yet, only two of those are designed for direct user interaction because \texttt{DPGToken} is managed completely autonomously.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \ac{DPG} can add/remove agencies and garbage collectors via \texttt{DPGActorManager}
%  \item actors and consumers can report to/withdraw from either \texttt{DPGBasic} or \texttt{DPGPenalty}
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conversion of Deposits}
To this point, it has been assumed that each deposit will be exchanged for Ether of equal value. Considering Ethereum's volatile nature and that of almost any cryptocurrency, this procedure poses a serious concern when thinking about the reward or settlement process. In the worst case, the fluctuation could diminish all of the locked down funds, requiring \ac{DPG} to either reject reimbursement claims or go into debt themselves. Two possible solutions can be thought of depending on the type of blockchain used in production:

\begin{description}
	\item[Public]
	\hfill \\
	When using Ethereum's public permissionless blockchain, fluctuations are inevitable. However, projects known as stablecoins (e.g.~Tether, MakerDAO, Digix) attempt to create a currency of constant value. Many of these are backed by a collateral, pegged to traditional fiat currencies or assets (e.g.~1 gram of gold) and most importantly, traded as fungible (see~\ref{sec:fungibility}) Ethereum tokens \cite{}. Despite each project having its own drawbacks, such a stablecoin could be utilized to better safeguard the funds. The protocol would work as follows: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
  		\item acquire adequate amount of stablecoin tokens upon receiving a deposit
  		\item reimburse refund claimant with stablecoin tokens
	\end{enumerate}

	Of course, this would happen automatically and could be achieved through a separate proxy contract that interacts with a decentralized exchange before returning control to the actual contract method called. 
	
	\item[Permissioned]
	\hfill \\
	A more predictable approach involves permissioned blockchains, commonly referred to as private deployments. These are operated by a known, authorized set of miners who use Ether at constant value \cite{}. Ergo, the solution can be used as is, though assumes that:

	\begin{itemize}
  		\item \ac{DPG} operates a public fixed-price exchange to buy/sell internal Ether
  		\item actors and consumers can freely transact and create accounts
	\end{itemize}
	
	The system would then be used with the following peculiarities:
		
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item initial distributors exchange deposit for adequate amount of internal Ether 
  		\item agencies, consumers and claimants exchange their internal Ether when needed
	\end{itemize}
	
	Now, one may suggest that a similar approach could be taken in a public blockchain environment, if a second token representing a constant deposit value is used. The problem, however, is that tokens cannot be sent along as a regular function argument. This is due to the fact that tokens are merely a recoding in application state which means that a particular contract has used its storage to remember how many tokens any given address possesses \cite{}. At the same time, this is also completely true for Ether itself with the exception being that miners automatically deduct one's balance should they encounter that a transaction has specified a non-zero amount of Ether \cite{}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Design Rationale}
\subsubsection{Accountless}
%The architecture detailed so far has numerous implications as to how that particular implementation of an incentivized deposit-refund system will be used, the most obvious one being that the only permitted means of identification is an Ethereum address. Nonetheless, x
Modeling the entire system as a series of interactions with a smart-contract is a deliberate design choice because, by definition, it prescribes all users to be authenticated with each request. This is due to the fact that only the private-key owning entity can sign transactions for that particular address (comp.~\ref{sec:accounts}) which allows for effortless authorization simply by maintaining a list of approved addresses. More importantly, consumers will not be required to register with yet another service just to leave their bank account details on a centralized server that is definitely more vulnerable to attacks than the decentralized ownership model embodied by public-key cryptography \footnote{A secure, non-constantly connected storage medium offers the greatest degree of protection against private-key theft. Devices, known as hardware wallets (e.g.~Ledger Nano S, Trezor), have been specifically designed for this purpose \cite{}.}. 

\subsubsection{Public Blockchain Value-Add}
From here, the general strengths of a public blockchain deployment should be highlighted with respect to the non-functional requirements set for an incentivized deposit-refund system in \autoref{sec:NFRs}.

\begin{description}
	\item[Availability (\ref{itm:operatingTimes})]
	\hfill \\
	The application will most certainly experience 100\% availability because the likelihood of all 17.6k miners (comp.~\ref{sec:ethereumPopularity}) going offline is extremely low. As such, it will not be necessary that clients maintain a backlog of unsent reports. Furthermore, the transaction pool itself will act as a backlog, should Ethereum experience an overly high demand in which it is unable to directly process a request.
	\item[Cost (\ref{itm:operatingCost})]
	\hfill \\
	Assuming a constant gas price and distribution of request types, the operating costs will always be proportional to the application's traffic (i.e.~number of contract invocations) as only the actual computation expended by a miner will be billed (comp.~\ref{sec:gas}). In this sense, the one-time fee paid for deployment is negligible \cite{}.
%	\item[Reliability (\ref{itm:unlimitedGrowth})]
%	\hfill \\
%	Assuming an error-free contract code, any well-formed request will be handled 100\% of the time as the system will always be available.
	\item[Efficiency (\ref{itm:responseTime})]
	\hfill \\
	Presuming that a miner will not randomly leave out transactions and always prefer transactions with a higher gas price, any request will execute by the end of the day, if its gas price has been set high enough. 
	\item[Integrity (\ref{itm:calculcations})]
	\hfill \\
	Provided that the contract code is error-free, any report will be recorded as is because all transactions are atomic \cite{}. Further, all input arguments are strongly typed \cite{}, so that, if required, only integers will be accepted.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Withdrawal Pattern}
There are two particular reasons as to why refunded penalties are credited for later withdrawal instead of being sent to the owner directly or paid out as part of the bottle return process. First, the withdrawal pattern generally represents an Ethereum best practice because it avoids reentrancy attacks \cite{}. This is also one of the reasons why rewards and donations have to be withdrawn. Secondly, it would be very impractical to incorporate this step into the bottle return process as reverse vending machines would otherwise have to look up the penalty and convert it to fiat. Alternatively, the amount could be refunded directly, although this would require tack-back points to keep an additional record and submit that record as part of a refund claim, necessitating even more changes to the current infrastructure.
