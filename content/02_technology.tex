\section{Deposit-Refund System for Bottled Beverages in Germany}
\subsection{Legal Basis}
\label{sec:legalBasis}
Anticipating the depletion of capacity in disposal sites and due to the considerable share in waste generated by packaging \footnote{Recycling rate of packaging was below 50\% in the early 1990s (20\% for aluminium and plastic)\hide{\cite{GVM2010}} \cite[p.~2]{Hartlep2011Recycling}.} \cite[p.~2]{Hartlep2011Recycling}, German federal government enacted an ordinance regarding the avoidance of packaging waste (\textit{Verordnung über die Vermeidung von Verpackungsabfällen}, short: \textit{\ac{VerpackV}}) in 1991 which stipulates that packaging \cite[§~1]{verpackV1991}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item must be minimised to an extent necessary for protection and marketing of goods
  \item must be reused where possible
  \item must be recycled if reuse is not applicable 
\end{itemize}

These objectives were supported by introducing the:

\begin{description}
	\item[Obligation to take back packaging]
	\hfill \\
	Producers and distributors of packaging are obliged to take back packaging free of charge, restricted to those goods of type, shape, size and material found within their stock \cite[§§~4-6]{verpackV1991}. Distributors with a retail area of less than 200$m^2$ are further exempted to the same brands. This duty may be only be ignored if a distributor participates in a system which ensures the periodical collection of waste \cite[§~6]{verpackV1991}, known and implemented as a refuse recycling system (\textit{duales System}) in 1990 \cite[p.~3]{Hartlep2011Recycling}.
	\item[Obligation to levy deposits on \gls{beverage packaging}]
	\hfill \\
	A deposit is to be charged by the distributor that will be refunded to the purchaser upon return of the bottle. This duty is applicable on all levels of trade involving domestic beverages sold in non-\gls{reusable packaging} (\textit{one-way packaging}) \cite[§~7]{verpackV1991} and becomes effective as soon as the quote of reusable beverage packaging falls below 72\% \footnote{Aggregated quote derived from weighted average of percentages of reusable packaging encountered across individual segments in 1990 \cite[§~9]{verpackV1991} \cite[p.~134]{Rummler/Schutt1991}} \cite[§~9]{verpackV1991}.

\end{figure}

Starting in 1997, the threshold to levy deposits has been surpassed steadily (comp. \autoref{fig:reusableQuoteDevelopment}), requiring an additional assessment of the situation to ensure that the fluctuation does not represent a short-term development \cite[§ 9]{verpackV1991} \cite[p.~5]{Hartlep2011Recycling}. Although obvious at glance, the outcome of a compulsory deposit-refund system only became official on July 2\textsuperscript{nd}, 2002 \cite[p.~49]{Geyer/Smoltczyk2003}, after a lawsuit lead by multiple bottlers and distributors had delayed the initial announcement \cite{spon2011handel}. Introduction of this mandatory system was scheduled for Jan 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2003 \cite[p.~53]{Geyer/Smoltczyk2003}.

\subsection{Amendments}
The German packaging ordinance underwent several revisions, including a change of title to highlight the importance of recycling \cite{verpackV1998}. In the following, the most important changes affecting the current state (see \autoref{fig:depositCriteria}) shall be highlighted.

\begin{description}
	\item[1998]
	\hfill \\
	Trims deposit obligation to those beverages for which the quote of reusable packaging has fallen when compared to 1991, though still necessitates that overall aggregated quote undercuts threshold of 72\% \cite[pp.~142]{Flanderka1999}. Even though all five segments (beer, mineral water, carbonated soft drinks, fruit juice/non-carbonated soft drinks and wine) have failed this comparison \cite[p.~1]{BMU2015}, juices/non-carbonated soft drinks and wine are exempted because their decline and market volume has not been regarded significant enough to justify the costs introduced with such a system \hide{\cite[pp.~1]{BMU 2002}} \cite[pp.~6,~9]{Hartlep2011Recycling}. 
	
\todo[inline]{figure showcasing development of reusable packing quote in each segment (appendix)}

	\item[2005]
	\hfill \\
	Reduces different deposit classifications to single deposit worth \EUR{0.25} valid for all applicable beverages with a filling volume between 0.1 - 3.0 litres. Furthermore, \gls{ecologically advantageous packaging} is admitted the same treatment and classification as that of reusable packaging which represents an important shift of thought since the sole utilisation of packaging has been considered inferior to its reuse with regard to all ecological aspects \hide{\cite[p.~1]{BMU 2010c}} \cite[p.~7]{Hartlep2011Recycling}. Accordingly, the new goal is to promote the use of ecologically advantageous packaging with a target of 80\% market dominance \cite[§~1]{verpackV2008}. This amendment also adds non-carbonated soft drinks and mixed alcoholic drinks to the list of beverages subject to deposits (irrespective of the reusable packaging quote experienced) while simultaneously protecting dietary products from deposits \cite[p.~1408]{verpackV2005} \cite[p.~171]{Flanderka/Stroetmann2009}. Finally, retailers are required to take back any bottles made from a beverage packaging material (glas, metal, paper and plastic) also sold by that store (brand equality for retail areas of less than 200$m^2$ still applies) \hide{\cite[p.~1]{BMU 2010c}}\hide{\cite[p.~7]{BMU 2010b}} \cite[p.~11]{Hartlep2011Recycling}. Previously, return had been limited to bottles of same shape, size [..] and type (comp. \ref{sec:legalBasis}). This regulation attempts to stop isolated deposit-refund systems which arose because discounters created their own specially shaped bottles \cite[p.~168]{Flanderka/Stroetmann2009}. To conform with this change, industry and commerce established the \acl{DPG}, responsible for setting up a nationwide deposit-refund system \hide{\cite[p.~1]{BMU 2010c}} \cite[p.~8]{Hartlep2011Recycling}.
	
	\item[2008]
	\hfill \\
	Orders distributors to clearly mark bottles as being obliged to a deposit. Further, distributors are demanded to participate in a nationwide deposit-refund system to enable the mutual settlement of claimed deposits \cite[§~9]{verpackV2008}. Lastly, the exemption for dietary products is reduced to infant nutrition. This acts as a measure to counteract increasingly false product declarations attempting to forego deposits \cite[pp. 531]{verpackV2008} \cite[p.~171]{Flanderka/Stroetmann2009}.

\subsection{Operation}

\subsubsection{Administration by \acl{DPG}}
\ac{VerpackV} simply assumes that a nationwide deposit-refund system will be installed by May 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2006 without further specifying its exact implementation details \cite[Art.~2]{verpackV2005} \cite[§~9]{verpackV2008}. Therefore, \ac{DPG} has been founded in 2005 to ensure the definition of a standards framework, which includes IT-processes, APIs and a universal security mark identifying one-way packaged bottles on which a deposit is paid (\textit{returnable bottle}). Other tasks concern the management of contracts, certifications and maintenance of a centralised database which stores information about products, participants and reverse vending machines \cite[pp.~13]{Hartlep2011Recycling}\hide{\cite[pp.~96]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}. However, \ac{DPG} does not have access to purchasing data (e.g. number of sold and returned bottles or total amount of reimbursed deposits). This data is only exchanged between actors of the deposit-refund cycle. Consequently, \ac{DPG} is not involved in the process of settling refund claims between take-back points and does not act as a central clearing house. It is exclusively responsible for providing a contractual and administrative basis needed to enable such a system \cite[p.~14]{Hartlep2011Recycling}.

\todo[inline]{figure showcasing universal security mark (appendix)}

\subsubsection{Roles}
As indicated, actors of the deposit-refund cycle (e.g. retailer selling returnable bottles) must register with \ac{DPG}, accept the contractual basis for the role to be exercised and pay a yearly membership fee in order to participate\hide{\cite[p.~15]{Hartlep2011Recycling}}\hide{\cite[p.~34]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}. The most important roles are \hide{\cite[pp.~33-34]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}} \cite[pp.~15-16]{Hartlep2011Recycling}:   

\begin{description}
	\item[Initial distributor]
	\hfill \\
	Puts returnable bottle into circulation. Inherently tied to role of deposit escrow account manager. Must pay a one-time fee to register a beverage (i.e. an \acs{EAN}) with \ac{DPG}'s central database. This fee depends on the number of pieces produced within a year for that beverage.
%	Commonly exercised by bottler or importer but may also include retailers selling their own brands.
	\item[Deposit escrow account manager]
	\hfill \\
	Administrates and disburses money received from levying deposit on returnable bottle. Task may be delegated to a service provider.
	\item[Take-back point]
	\hfill \\
	Refunds consumer in exchange for returning bottles subject to deposits. Inherently tied to role of refund claimant.
	\item[Refund claimant]
	\hfill \\
	Puts in a claim to be reimbursed for making advance refunds. Task may be delegated to a service provider.
	\item[Counting center operator]
	\hfill \\
	Takes over role of reverse vending machine by confirming number of genuinely accepted bottles with a receipt. 
	
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Deposit-Refund Cycle}
Each buyer of a returnable bottle must directly pay the designated deposit to the seller. This process starts with the initial distributor (step 1 of \autoref{fig:depositRefundCycle}) and is repeated for each sub-distributor until the bottles reaches retail which acts as the final distributor to end consumers (step 2 of \autoref{fig:depositRefundCycle}). After consumption, the consumer may return the packaging at any retail store obliged to take back the packaging in question (take-back point) (step 3 of \autoref{fig:depositRefundCycle}). Return may be performed manually (step 1a of \autoref{fig:clearingProcess}) or can be automated through reverse vending machines (step 1b of \autoref{fig:clearingProcess}). The former requires personnel to count the number of returned bottles and refund the consumer accordingly. Following count, the collected bottles must be shipped to a counting center which is responsible for digitally capturing each bottle (step 2a of \autoref{fig:clearingProcess})\hide{\cite[p.~76]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}\hide{\cite[p.~17]{Hartlep2011Recycling}}. At last, the bottles will be compressed to eliminate the possibility of repeated refunds\hide{\cite[p.~77]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}. In the case of reverse vending machines, the process of counting, capturing and compressing bottles can take place locally at a retail store (step 2b of \autoref{fig:clearingProcess})\hide{\cite[p.~76]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}. Alternatively, retailers are permitted to return the packaging to the previous distributor, thereby unwinding the deposit-refund chain. However, this practice is rarely exercised since the packaging will not be reused and transportation would only induce additional ecological and financial strain\hide{\cite[p.~17]{Hartlep2011Recycling}}. Instead, the compressed packaging can be sold directly to recycling companies (step 3 of \autoref{fig:clearingProcess}) \cite[p.~16-17]{Hartlep2011Recycling} \cite{reiling}.

  \label{fig:depositRefundCycle}
\end{figure}

Since take-back points refund consumers independent of a bottle’s purchasing location, a settlement process (\textit{clearing}) is required to reimburse retailers for making advance refunds (step 4 of \autoref{fig:depositRefundCycle}). This clearing happens by issuing a refund invoice to the initial distributor who can use the deposits originally collected the pay the bill (step 4 of \autoref{fig:clearingProcess}). Ideally, all accounts are in balance, meaning that all packaging has been returned. Otherwise, a surplus on the part of an initial distributor is to be experienced \cite[p.~17]{Hartlep2011Recycling}.

  \caption{Clearing process for manual and automated bottle returns \cite[p.~18]{Hartlep2011Recycling}}
  \label{fig:clearingProcess}
\end{figure}

Refund invoices must also include data representing the number of bottles for which a refund was issued. This data originates from the return process in which each bottle is eventually captured. Capture refers to both validating the universal security mark printed on a bottle’s label as well as extracting the \ac{EAN} by scanning its barcode. By outfitting reverse vending machines with a network connection, looking up the \ac{EAN} in question becomes possible, thus ensuring that a deposit for the bottle has been collected beforehand\hide{\cite[pp.~2]{Wincor Nixdorf 2010}}. For each valid bottle, a signed record is then produced and stored on the machine\hide{\cite[p.~18]{Hartlep2011Recycling}}. This data must be retrieved and transmitted within one week\hide{\cite[p.~90]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}. Likewise, retailers receive a similar dataset when relying on a counting center\hide{\cite[p.~18]{Hartlep2011Recycling}}. Finally, any transmitted data is anonymised by removing the return location and summing up the refunds for each \ac{EAN} captured\hide{\cite[pp.~90]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}}. Initial distributors must pay the invoice within ten business days or five-teen calendar days at the lastet \hide{\cite[p.~40]{DPG/Roland Berger 2010}} \cite[p.~18-19]{Hartlep2011Recycling}.
